Rechecking... $S=19 \rightarrow 38$, $U=21 \rightarrow 42$, $M=13 \rightarrow 26$. Sum = $38+42+26=106$. There appears to be a calculation error in my initial setup.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Let their present ages be 17x and 7x. 6 years ago, $(17x-6)/(7x-6) = 3/1$. $17x-6 = 3(7x-6) \\Rightarrow 17x-6 = 21x-18 \\Rightarrow 4x = 12 \\Rightarrow x=3$. Father's present age is $17 \\times 3 = 51$ years."
